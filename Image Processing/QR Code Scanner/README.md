In this Task you need to scan and detect the QR Code sucessfully and then display the contents or information which
is encoded in it on the python output terminal. Also write the output on the output image as well. You also need to draw 
a bounding rectangle after detecting the QR Code.

## What are QR Codes?

<img align = "center" width = "500" height = "280" src = "https://github.com/varun7860/Artificial-Intelligence/blob/main/Image%20Processing/QR%20Code%20Scanner/Assets/QR%20Codes.png">

QR Codes are nothing but machine readable codes that contain important information. Following is kind of information
contained in a typical QR Code:
1. `Version Information` : consist of the version of the QR code.
2. `Format Information` : Formatting details of the QR code.
3. `Data and error correction keys` : QR codes can sometimes be scanned because of these keys even if the code is damaged.
4. `Patterns` : Contains Position, Alignment and Timing information of the QR Code.
5. `Quiet or Blank Zone` : Blank region outside the boundary of QR Code.

To built the project you need to get familiar with the learning modules given below. You can use ideas from these modules but don't copy paste the code.
Learn them step by step in the sequence given below:

1. [Computer Vision](https://tryolabs.com/resources/introductory-guide-computer-vision/)
2. [Python Programming](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
3. [Open CV library](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/opencv-python-tutorial/)
4. [Image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing)
