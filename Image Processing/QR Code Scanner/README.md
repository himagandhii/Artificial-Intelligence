<img align = "center" width = "400" height = "534" src = "https://github.com/varun7860/Artificial-Intelligence/blob/main/Image%20Processing/QR%20Code%20Scanner/Assets/QR%20Code.jpg">

In this Task you need to scan and detect the QR Code sucessfully and then display the contents or information which
is encoded in it on the python output terminal. Also write the output on the output image as well. You also need to draw 
a bounding rectangle after detecting the QR Code.

## What are QR Codes?

To built the project you need to get familiar with the learning modules given below. You can use ideas from these modules but don't copy paste the code.
Learn them step by step in the sequence given below:

1. [Computer Vision](https://tryolabs.com/resources/introductory-guide-computer-vision/)
2. [Python Programming](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
3. [Open CV library](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/opencv-python-tutorial/)
4. [Image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing)
