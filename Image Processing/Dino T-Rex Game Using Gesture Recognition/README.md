In this task you need to control a game called "T-Rex" using Gestures through simple computer vision techniques. Your program should
detect the gestures made by you and then autopress a key on your system to control the game. Following things should be achieved after
the task is completed:

1. `Whenever plays makes a gesture the dinosaur should jump`
2. `There should be low latency between the gesture made by the player and the jump made by the dinosaur.`
3. `Gesture controller should be marked by a rectangle or square on the camera feed. When the controller moves the square or rectangle should also move along with it`.
4. `The Code should be commented and well linted.You can use pylint to lint your code.`
5. `The key on system should be autopressed to make the dinosaur jump`


## About the Game

T-Rex or also called Jumping Dinosaur is an built-in browser game in google chrome web browser. To play the game, the player has to tap the dinosaur or
press the space, up or down key to make the dinosaur jump over the obstacles. If the dinosaur hits the obstacle then the game is over and the player has 
to start over the game again with 0 points. Given below are the two links where you can find this game:
