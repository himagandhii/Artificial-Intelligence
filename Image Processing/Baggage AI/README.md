<BR>
   
In this task you will have two sets of images. One are scanned X-ray images of an ordinary bag and sceond the scanned x-ray
images of threat objects. Threat objects are the ones which possess threat to humans or any organization. Knife, explosives, guns or
any kind of sharp object are the examples of threat images. Your task is to crop a threat object, rotate it by 45 degrees and then 
merge it with the baggage image. It should not like the threat image is copy pasted. It should look like if the threat object was 
already present in the baggage image. You can adjust the transparency of threat object to achieve this. Following things should be
achieved at the end of the task:

<BR>

1. `Threat objects should be translucent, means it should not look like that it is cut pasted. It should look like that the threat`
   `was already there in the background images.`
   
<BR>
   
2. `Translucent means the threat objects should have shades of background where it is pasted.`
3. `Threat should not go outside the boundary of the baggage. **difficult**`
4. `If there is any background of threat objects, then it should not be cut pasted into the`
`background images, which means while cutting the threat objects, the boundary of a threat`
`object should be tight-bound.`

## Sample Threat Image

<img align = "center" width = "231"  height = "272" src = "https://github.com/varun7860/Artificial-Intelligence/blob/main/Image%20Processing/Baggage%20AI/Assets/threat.jpg">

## Sample baggage Image

<img align = "center" width = "231"  height = "300" src = "https://github.com/varun7860/Artificial-Intelligence/blob/main/Image%20Processing/Baggage%20AI/Assets/Bag.jpg">


## Sample Output Image
<img align = "center" width = "231"  height = "300" src = "https://github.com/varun7860/Artificial-Intelligence/blob/main/Image%20Processing/Baggage%20AI/Assets/Output%20Image.png">
