In this task you will have two sets of images. One are scanned X-ray images of an ordinary bag and sceond the scanned x-ray
images of threat objects. Threat objects are the ones which possess threat to humans or any organization. Knife, explosives, guns or
any kind of sharp object are the examples of threat images. Your task is to crop a threat object, rotate it by 45 degrees and then 
merge it with the baggage image. It should not like the threat image is copy pasted. It should look like if the threat object was 
already present in the baggage image. You can adjust the transparency of threat object to achieve this.
