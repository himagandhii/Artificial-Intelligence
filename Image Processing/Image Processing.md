Image Processing is a sub-branch of Artificial Intelligence which deals with improving the quality of Image Data. It consists of using a 
digital computer to process digital images using the known Algorithms. It allows using multiple algorithms which prevents building up noise,
distortion and other outliers in an image.

### What is an Image?
Image is a two dimensional function `F(x,y)` where x is the width and y is the height of the image. The value of F(x,y) gives the value of
the pixel at that point. The amplitude(A) of "F" is called the intensity of an image. When the values of x,y and A are finite then the image
if called a digital image otherwise the image is an analog image. As the function consists of two values ie x and y an image is represented by
two dimensional matrix with x rows and y columns. A digital image comprises of finite number of elements called pixels. Pixels are denoted as the
elements of digital image.

### Types of Images
1. Binary Image: Consist of only two pixel values 1 and 0. 0 refers to black and 1 refers to white.
2. Black and white Image: This Image consists of only black and white colour.Unlike binary image black and white image doesn't have only two pixel 
                          values(ie 1 and 0).
3. GrayScale Images: It is an image based on 8 bit colour format. It has pixel values from 0-255 where 0 is black, 1 is white and  127 is the grayscale value.
4. Colour Images: These images are based on 16 bit colour format and 24 bit colour format. 16 bit colour format is the one that is widely used in
                  colour image processing. It has 65,536 different colours in it.
                  
### Image in mathematical form
 An image is given in the matrix form by :
