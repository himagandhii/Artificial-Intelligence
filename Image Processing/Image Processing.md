# Image Processing and Computer Vision
Image Processing is a sub-branch of Artificial Intelligence which deals with improving the quality of Image Data. It consists of using a 
digital computer to process digital images using the known Algorithms. It allows using multiple algorithms which prevents building up noise,
distortion and other outliers in an image.
